2. Image Display:

Display a grid layout that showcases a collection of images presented in a visually appealing manner with consistent spacing and sizing, add a tag to each image.

3.  Loading state

The page should have a loading state for when images are not ready for display, display a skeleton loader or a loading spinner when loading is true

4. Search Functionality

You should have a search field that filters the image list based on the tags added to the images.
